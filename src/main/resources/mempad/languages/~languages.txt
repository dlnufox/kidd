Important notes for editing or creating language files
------------------------------------------------------

>>       If the name of the language (file name) is in English it will
         be auto-detected, else selection in MemPad menu is required.

>>       *.lng files can be opened with a text editor
>>       To edit: pls open your language + English side by side

>>       You can edit the *.lng files while MemPad is open, however, 
         the changes will be effective only after restarting MemPad.

>>       Missing text items will show in English
         The default language (English) is built-in.

>>       The numbers identify a text item. 
>>       Lines beginning with semicolon as well as empty lines are ignored

>>       A Dollar sign is a token for something to insert by MemPad (pls test)

Menu items:

>>       A question mark indicates that this is a toggle (on/off).

>>       Insert an ampersand ("&") before a letter to be marked as hotkey
         The first character is the default hotkey
         Note: Hotkeys expect that the menu is opened by keyboard (not by mouse)
