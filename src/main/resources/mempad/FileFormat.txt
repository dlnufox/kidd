MemPad File Format - in case you are interested

New 3.++ format 

Header string:

    7 bytes:        constant "MeMpAd " (including one blank space)
    followed by:    initial page to load (one or more char digits), terminated by zero byte
    followed by:    Quick Page Path (if available), terminated by zero byte

For each Page:

    level:          byte binary 1..99 
    Page title:     String (max 64 bytes) terminated by zero byte 
                    Ver 3.31++
                    If a TAB character is found, the rest of the string
                    contains additional header information, currently the
                    background color code ($nnnnnn) 
    Page contents:  String terminated by zero byte 


Note: If the "MeMpAd " signature at the beginning of the file is not found, Mempad assumes that this file is encrypted, and asks for the password.
